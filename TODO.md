# TODO

Execution worksheet: the stages of work in flight, one section per stage.
A section is removed when its stage lands, and the squash commit that
lands it is the record; how the system got here lives in git history and
in the frozen [docs/history/](docs/history/README.md). Steps marked
**USER** need the operator: a decision, or a console or IAM action the
system must not take itself.

Current stage: **none in progress**.

Open stages and their order: §48, the open hygiene bundle, whenever
convenient; §47 waits on the operator's `gcs` decision; §19 and §30 wait
on the operator's decisions.

Standing decisions (operator):

- The documentation describes what is; no document carries a commit hash;
  a landed stage is recorded by its squash message, not by a ledger or an
  archive entry.
- A hygiene issue that should be fixed but does not threaten function goes
  into the open **hygiene bundle** stage as a numbered item, not into a
  stage of its own and not only into a commit message. If no bundle is
  open, start one. Work that is large, or that blocks something, still
  earns its own stage.
- Publication is done: both repositories are public, each a single commit
  built from a redacted tree, with the pre-publication history private and
  archived. The identifiers (account id, project number, VPC, subnet and
  security-group ids, image ids, the state bucket, the Okta org and OPA
  team) are public by decision; the live rosters are real and encrypted to
  the four recipients; the fixture's people are synthetic.
- All terraform state stays in the AWS S3 backend by design; a GCS backend
  for the GCE roots and per-runtime networking validation are the very
  last priorities and are not stages; a session identity for the runtime
  session hook other than the operator's login key is deferred.
- No new GCP work unless a change is likely to make the existing GCP code
  fail; then the GCE cycle runs as the proof, on the operator's account,
  and is torn down. GCP is the operator's money.
- `main` performs (stage 45): a push to `main` records the full
  configuration, then bakes, releases and applies retention on the AWS
  runtime under the write role, then records again. The GCE runtime stays
  out of CI: a declaration change there fails the job before anything
  performs. A push to `main` is the operator's act.
- Releases publish to an index (stage 41, landed 2026-09-17): PyPI,
  TestPyPI first, every version through `just release <part|version>
  [test|pypi]`; the first upload, `0.1.1.dev1`, is on TestPyPI and
  installs from it into a fresh virtualenv (an install in the seconds after
  an upload can fail to resolve until the index has propagated). Versions
  on TestPyPI will be deleted during development, and a deleted version is
  never re-cut. The first final version (`just release stage pypi`, after
  a green `full-test` with docker on a clean live configuration, with
  `PYPI_TOKEN` in place) is the operator's call; trusted publishing
  replaces the tokens once the package names are stable.
- §19 (the first real model image) stays planned by the operator's
  instruction; §30 (the contract package) is planned.

---

## 19. The first real model image, released and in use

**Why**: the system's stated purpose (EXPLORE "Systemic Purpose") is
images that are correct for a given HPC model, formally released, with
scientists logging in. The retrospective's warning still stands — "the
doorway got finished before the building": the fixture's playbooks are
placeholders (DESCRIPTION.md), the dask image installs dask and nothing
else, and no image has been used by anyone. Every mechanism the purpose
needs now exists: shell + ansible modifications with local mod tests,
in-bake and post-bake tests, declared releases, `require_released_builds`,
group ownership → OPA access (proven by `sft ssh` in stage 1), storage
attached by group. This stage spends them on one model, on AWS.

1. **USER — the model**: which one first (the groups are named for them:
   coops, stofs, secofs, tcmet); what its image must contain (packages,
   model source or binaries, data paths); what "correct" means as tests
   (a smoke run of the model, expected files and services); who its users
   are (the group's members); the instance size and the standing hours it
   may cost on the AWS account; its storage (the existing `mnt_data` /
   `efs-storage` / bucket, or new declarations).
2. **The image**: `basic-rh-10` on AWS plus an instance image owned by
   the model's group; real modifications — ansible for the stack, bash
   `ensure` for glue — idempotent and passing `just test-mods`; in-bake
   `tests:` and `tests.post_bake` running the model's smoke test;
   `release: {model: <name>}`.
3. **The instance(s)**: declared for the group with `image_policy: pinned`
   and `require_released_builds: true` (only a released build may pin);
   storage per the decision; launched through the gates on AWS (private
   subnet, no public IP; the existing network configuration untouched —
   standing constraint).
4. **Users in**: the group's members log in through the Okta gateway
   relay (`sft ssh`); evidence captured, the stage-1 shape.
5. **Operations, once**: the upgrade path exercised end to end (`upgrade
image` → re-bake → `upgrade instance` → gated replace) so the model's
   second release is a procedure, not a discovery; the standing cost noted
   for the AWS account.
6. Records: ledger, PLAN, OPERATIONS "a model image, end to end".
   Feature branch `feature/model-<name>`, squash-merged, kept.

## 30. The plugin contract is a package of protocols

**Why**: a plugin author should be able to write a plugin against ONE
package — `cs-image-system-contract` — and never import, let alone
subclass, the core's base classes. The base classes are the convenient
implementation of that contract, not the contract itself; a plugin that
satisfies the protocols structurally is a first-class plugin. That is the
operator's stated goal (2026-09-13) and it reverses the direction §29 had
taken (fold the protocols into the bases): the protocols are kept and made
real. Today the promise is not delivered: `base/protocols/` imports
`constants`, `registry` and the field helpers from the rest of `base`; a
plugin's own `pyproject.toml` depends on `cs-image-system-system` (the CLI
host); plugins import from ~60 core modules and ~106 names, of which ~24
are functions whose first argument is the live run context, reached
through the `GlobalTypeContext` singleton at ~50 sites; the mapper
dispatches on base-class identity; and two things already satisfy a
protocol structurally only by accident (`ProviderSpecificImage`, and every
`BuilderBase` at the registry's gate). Measured 2026-09-13 with the
per-plugin distance: `tf-s3-state-plugin` needs 7 core names,
`tf-ebs-instance-plugin` 42 plus 24 context reaches.

**Honest cost**, in three tiers: the two static tiers (models, behaviour)
are ~3–4 days of mostly mechanical work; the context interface is 1–2
weeks and is the part that makes an external plugin real; the proving
plugin 1–2 days. Call it three weeks, done as three branches.

1. **The package**: `packages/contract` → `cs_image_system.contract`, a
   workspace member with NO dependency on `base` or `system` (pydantic and
   `packaging` only); `base` depends on it, never the reverse, and a test
   asserts the import direction. It carries the constants protocols need
   (`VCT`, `FK_TARGET`, `DEFAULT`/`SELF`/`OOPS_DEFAULTS`),
   `CSIS_MODEL_CONFIG`, `fk_field`/`templated_field`, the lifecycle enums
   (`ExecutionLifecyclePhase`, `Lifecycle`, `LifecycleSpec`, `HookSet`) and
   the value types a plugin constructs (`Asset`/`AssetSet`,
   `ExecutableModel`, `CFExecutables`) — concrete data carriers are part
   of a contract; behaviour is not.
2. **Tier A — model protocols** (structural, with attribute declarations):
   `NameTyped` (`name`, `type_`, `description`, `aliases`, `global_id`,
   `get_classification`), `BuilderModel`, and one per builder kind
   (runtime, os, storage, image, instance, mod, group, user, state) with
   exactly the attributes the core reads. A plugin model is any pydantic
   dataclass under `CSIS_MODEL_CONFIG` that satisfies them; the `type`
   alias and `fk_field` metadata are the contract's, exported. The
   `ParentPropertyHolding` attribute (`_model_id`) is declared in the
   protocol and by each implementer — a protocol cannot carry a dataclass
   field, which is why it is copied at nine sites today; `base` offers a
   pydantic-dataclass mixin as the convenience, and the copies in the
   core's own models go through it.
3. **Tier B — behaviour protocols**: `PluginMetadata` (the seven
   properties; `AbstractPluginMetadata`'s `version` bug — it returns the
   metadata version — fixed on the way), `PluginArtifact`
   (`csis_name`/`csis_classifier`), and the builder surface: the six
   universal lifecycle hooks (`generate_items_{before,during,after}`,
   `get_commands_to_run_{before,during,after}`) as `Builder`, plus one
   protocol per kind for the ~60 domain hooks (`StorageBuilder`:
   `module_args`, `capability_type`, `attachment_cardinality`,
   `transition_actions`, `supports_archive`…; `RuntimeBuilder`: the 16
   query/session/dispose hooks; `GroupBuilder`, `ImageBuilder`,
   `InstanceBuilder`, `ModBuilder`, `UserBuilder`, `StateBuilder`). The
   protocols carry NO implementation (today `NameTypedProtocol` supplies
   `global_id` and a `get_classification` default; those bodies move to
   the base classes). `StateManagementRootProtocol` is dead — zero
   implementers — and is deleted.
4. **Tier C — the context protocol**, the expensive part: `RunContext`
   with the ~55 members plugins read (top: `meta_state`,
   `runtime_builders`, `os_builders`, `run_id`, `instances`, `images_map`,
   `generation_path`, `storage_builders`, `storages`, `dry_run`, …), with
   `MetaState` its own protocol (the mutable run records that the storage
   and instance builders write on both clouds); the ~24 context-first
   functions plugins import (`capabilities.*`, `lineage.*`,
   `launch_params.*`, `image_tests.*`, `storage_state.*`,
   `identity_attributes.*`, three from `commands.verify_instance`) either
   become methods of the protocol or are re-exported by the contract as
   functions typed against it. `GlobalTypeContext` implements it; the
   builder protocol receives the context by injection (`bind(ctx)`) so a
   plugin never constructs the singleton — the ~18 direct
   `GlobalTypeContext()` constructions in plugin code and the 33
   `_get_context()` calls go through it.
5. **The base classes implement the protocols** — `class NameTyped(…)`
   declares the protocol nominally as well, so pyright checks every base
   against it at definition time; a `contract.testing` module ships
   `assert_conforms(cls, protocol)` (signature-level, via `typing`
   introspection, stricter than `runtime_checkable`'s name-only check)
   and the core's tests run it over every base class and every built-in
   plugin. The two accidental structural implementers become deliberate:
   `ProviderSpecificImage` and `BuilderBase` conform by the same test.
6. **Runtime checks stay structural** and move to the contract's
   protocols: `loader.py` (`PluginMetadata`), `registry.py`
   (`NameTyped`, `PluginArtifact`), the orchestrator's marker dispatch
   (`SelfInjectedName`, `ParentPropertyHolding`, `SubItemOverride`) — all
   `runtime_checkable`, all name-only at runtime, all backed by step 5's
   conformance test so the looseness is not the only check. The mapper:
   `PydanticConverter` drops its base-class identity table (`_base_vcts`)
   and dispatches by `csis_classifier()` for any registered dataclass that
   satisfies `NameTyped` — the registry already resolves plugin models by
   type key.
7. **Plugins depend on the contract**: every plugin's `pyproject.toml`
   depends on `cs-image-system-contract` and, only where it truly uses a
   core utility, on `base` (the ~12 pure helpers — `render_module_call`,
   `hcl_expr`, `super_safe_name`, … — move to the contract or to
   `hashicorp-utils`, which is declared for what it is: a library five
   plugins use, not a plugin). The three undeclared dependencies
   (`tf-ebs`→`aws_runtime`, `aws-runtime`/`gcloud-runtime`→`dummy_plugin`)
   are declared or removed; the three private cross-plugin imports
   (`_groups`, `_public_read`, `_make_credentials`) get public names. No
   plugin depends on `system`.
8. **The proof — an external plugin**: a new workspace member
   `packages/contract-example-plugin` implementing one trivial storage (or
   runtime) plugin against `cs_image_system.contract` ONLY — a test greps
   its source for `cs_image_system.base` and fails on any hit; it is
   loaded by entry point, its model structures from a fixture YAML, and it
   participates in a dry `run --all` over a copy of the frozen fixture
   with its module call emitted. That is the acceptance; without it the
   contract is a claim.
9. Residue carried from §29: fix `RuntimeBuilderBase`'s anonymous inline
   TypeVar (it was never generic); the nine `_model_id` copies in the core
   go through the mixin; the four type-escape hatches caused by the
   protocol/base split (`builder_base.py:61`, `orchestrator.py:681`,
   `registry.py:86`, `os_builder_runtime_config.py:173`) are fixed, not
   repointed. Golden byte-identical at every branch; bar green; pyright at
   0 errors. Records: ledger; DESIGN's plugin-contract section rewritten
   around the package; OPERATIONS "writing a plugin". Branches
   `feature/contract-package` (steps 1–3, 5–7),
   `feature/contract-context` (step 4), `feature/contract-example`
   (step 8), each squash-merged, kept.

## 47. State backends beyond S3

**Why**: an S3 bucket is not the only place terraform state can live, and
the system behaved as though it were.

**Done 2026-09-17** (`feature/state-backend-contract`,
`feature/state-backend-types`): the backend contract is type-agnostic --
`BackendRegistration` carries name, type, `is_default`, the type's own
settings and the *kind* that renders a root's `StateLocation`
(`<type>://<container>/<key>`), its backend file and a consumer's data
source; the collector names no field of any type; the S3 knowledge lives in
`tf-s3-state-plugin` as `S3BackendKind` and the emission stayed
byte-identical through the refactor. `local`, the type that needs nothing,
is the fifteenth package (`local-state-plugin`): `path` relative to the
configuration root or absolute, rendered from the root directory's fixed
depth. The fixture's identity roots bind to `local-dev`, so the golden
carries two types, two shapes of backend file and reads across types
(storage and instance roots in S3 reading identity state on disk); a real
`tofu init` runs against the local backend with an empty environment;
§46's collision check holds across types (the same name under two types is
two locations; two roots on one directory collide). The S3 plugin's README
carries "adding a backend type" as the recipe (a model plus one kind; the
next type is a day); CONFIGURATION has a section per type and OPERATIONS'
"Where state lives" covers both. No live state moved.

What remains is the operator's:

1. **USER — `gcs`, the obvious second cloud.** Fields: `bucket`, `prefix`,
   optional `credentials` (a path, never a value) and
   `impersonate_service_account`. Declaring the type is not the same as
   moving the GCE roots onto it: that remains the deferred, very-last-
   priority decision, and nothing binds a GCE root to it. The operator
   confirms that reading before the type is added, since it is the one
   place this stage brushes against a standing decision. With the recipe
   in place it is a model, a kind and a fixture entry -- a day.
2. Records by the current convention once 1 is decided (added or declined).

## 48. Hygiene bundle III: the small things noted during §43

**Why**: each was found while landing the second bundle and left alone
because it was not that stage's business; none threatens function. By the
standing decision they collect here rather than in stages of their own.
Whenever convenient; nothing waits on it.

1. **The version checkers never run.** `cfg/executables.yml` promises a
   version requirement per tool and four checkers exist (`aws-cli`,
   `ansible-playbook`, `bash`, `gcloud`), but they are registered by
   executable NAME while `validate` looks them up by TYPE
   (`check_single_version`), so no checker has ever matched and every
   requirement is unenforced. Wiring the lookup (name first, then type)
   would make the checks real, and at least one requirement is stale
   (`gcloud >=2026.02.0, <2027.01.0` cannot match a `5xx.0.0` version), so
   the change is: wire the lookup, correct the requirements in both trees
   against the versions CI and the operator actually run, and let
   `validate` fail on a real mismatch -- or delete the checkers and the
   requirements together. **USER** chooses. Until then §43 collapsed the
   noise to one INFO line.
2. **Three warnings every load prints that no one reads.**
   `template_utils.cycle_main_yaml` warns "Final cycled YAML still contains
   template tags" on every load (something legitimately unresolved at that
   stage, probably `{{ identified_model.name }}` on OS sub-configurations):
   find what remains and either resolve it or demote the message to DEBUG
   with the offending snippet. `parent_property_holding_protocol.model_id`
   warns "already has a model assigned … Overwriting" four times per load
   for `OSBuilderBaseImageBuilderSubconfig`: find the second assignment
   and make it one. `orchestrator.py`'s template resolver warns "marked as
   DEFAULT but has no 'fk_target' metadata" five times per load: either
   those fields should carry a target, or a DEFAULT that resolves to
   nothing is the declared meaning and the message goes to DEBUG.
3. **An unresolvable foreign key only warns.** `orchestrator.py` falls back
   to the raw id when an FK does not resolve, which is how the fixture and
   the live tree named a non-existent image builder for months. A field
   declared as an FK that names nothing should fail validation, with the
   field, the value and the target named; find every site that relies on
   the fallback first (a DEFAULT sentinel is not a failure).
4. **The builder-level ansible `playbooks` do nothing.** They are copied
   beside the Packer root and no provisioner references them (the ansible
   plugin's README records it). Either the item inherits them, as the
   field's description says, or the field goes.
5. **Vestigial `tofu-cache-dir` dependencies.** `cloud-preflight`,
   `cloud-dispose-images` and `cloud-relabel` depend on it and start no
   tofu; the executing recipes create the cache through the lock wrapper.
   Drop the dependency where nothing needs it.
6. **Two things the first performing run on `main` committed that may
   not belong in the record.** Packer's `manifest.json` landed under the
   block directory of the baked image, and every push to `main` now makes
   two record commits (the record and the closing record) whose only
   difference is run ids and stamps. Decide whether the manifest is a
   record (then the golden and the ignore policy say so) or run-local
   (then it joins `run-summary.json`), and whether the closing record
   should skip its commit when the emission differs only by run ids.
7. Records by the current convention. Feature branch
   `feature/hygiene-three`, squash-merged, kept. Half a day plus the USER
   decision.
